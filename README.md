# GLIMPSE_2021

Classification: Baseline - Muller et al., ours - Resnet based on Muller et al. with attention mechainsms joining RGB images with semantic segmentation maps. 

Semantic_Segmentation: HRNet model, code from CSAIL MIT. 

GAN: Pix2Pix trained to generate Google Earth rendered images from RGB images

Reranking: Triplet Network trained to rerank the top-k image geo-cell locations output by the classification network. It compares a query image to images from toop-k locations. It uses the Google Earth rendered images generated by the Pix2Pix GAN network to sample images from GPS coordinates without corresponding RGB images.
